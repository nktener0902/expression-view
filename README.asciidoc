= What is 

Expression viewer is a web application that converts an expression that user inputs to a graph.

This application also outputs plot data. User can use the plot data as sample data for machine learning.

= Getting started

This application depends on python3 and mongoDB.
Before using expression viewer, install them (See https://www.python.org/[Python], https://www.mongodb.com/[mongoDB]).

Create `config.json` from `_config.json`.
If necessary, change the parameters based on your environment.

If you can use Docker, input following commands.

[source,bash]
----
# Download
git clone https://github.com/nktener0902/expression-viewer.git
cd expression-viewer
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Create config.json
cp _config.json config.json
# Install dependent libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Start MongoDB
docker run --name some-mongo -p 27017:27017 -d mongo
# Start expression-viewer
python main.py
----

After starting expression-viewer, "expression-viewer" database will be created in MongoDB.

If you want to change configuration of web app, open `main.py` and edit settings of web app (host, port and debug).
